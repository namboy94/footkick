Footkick tracks some non-identifiable user behaviour data. Currently, the following is tracked with the help
of google analytics:

    - Every time a new screen is displayed, this change is sent to the analytics servers.
      It sends the name of the newly opened screen
    - Which country and which league data is viewed

The application does NOT collect any PERSONAL data.

In case an application build without the analytics tracking enabled is required/desired, there is an application
build available at https://github.com/namboy94/footkick/releases, named

    footkick-android-release-noanalytics-<version>.apk
