Footkick tracks some non-identifiable user behaviour data. Currently, the following is
tracked with the help of firebase analytics:

    - Every time a new screen is displayed, this change is sent to the analytics servers.
      It sends the name of the newly opened screen
    - Which country and which league data is viewed

The application does NOT collect any PERSONAL data.
