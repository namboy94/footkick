# Footkick

A Java Program and Android App that fetches online football information

Footkick is a simple football(soccer) information tool. It enables checking current league standings and the latest
match results or upcoming matches.

We use the data from www.livecore.com, which allows us to serve a huge amount of data for many countries, including
small nations like Namibia, but also the big powerhouses like Germany, England or Spain.

CLI Usage:

    java -jar footkick.jar <country> <league> [table|matchday|summary]
